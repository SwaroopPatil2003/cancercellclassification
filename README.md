Cancer Cell Classifier (96% Accuracy)
This project uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify cancerous cells with 96% accuracy. The model's performance is validated using F1 Score, Jaccard Index, and a Confusion Matrix.

How It Works
SVM Algorithm: Projects data into higher dimensions and classifies it using a kernel function (Linear, Polynomial, RBF, or Sigmoid â€“ all tested in main.ipynb).

Why SVM?: It's a great fit for this dataset, offering high accuracy even with a relatively small amount of data.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset: Available in the repository.

ðŸš€ Ready to predict cancer cells with high precision!
